# Microsoft Purview – Advanced Introduction and Deep Dive

---

## Chapter 1: Understanding the Need for Data Governance in the Modern Enterprise

### 1.1 Data Explosion and Complexity

Today’s businesses deal with massive volumes of data from numerous systems:

* **Operational systems** like SQL Server, Oracle, and SAP.
* **Cloud platforms** such as Azure, AWS, and GCP.
* **Modern SaaS applications** like Salesforce, Dynamics 365, and Workday.
* **End-user tools** like Excel, Power BI, and Teams.

This data is often siloed, duplicated, and inconsistently managed. As data grows:

* It becomes harder to discover, classify, or secure it.
* Regulatory obligations increase.
* Business agility suffers.

### 1.2 What is Data Governance?

**Data governance** is the set of rules, processes, roles, and technologies to ensure that data is:

* **Available** when needed,
* **Accurate** and of high quality,
* **Secure** from misuse,
* **Consistently defined** across the organization.

It ensures data is treated as a **strategic asset**.

### 1.3 Challenges Without Data Governance

Without governance, organizations face:

* **Duplicated work**: Same data recreated by different teams.
* **Conflicting definitions**: "Customer" or "Revenue" may vary.
* **Compliance risks**: Inability to track or secure PII.
* **Inaccurate reporting**: Decision-makers can't trust the data.
* **Security gaps**: Lack of visibility into sensitive data.

## Chapter 2: Introduction to Microsoft Purview

### 2.1 What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a **cloud-native, unified data governance solution** that allows organizations to manage and govern their data across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS platforms. It provides tools to:

* Discover data sources,
* Classify and catalog data,
* Track data lineage,
* Apply policies to control access,
* Create a shared business glossary.

It’s built to support **enterprise-scale metadata management** and **automated governance**.

### 2.2 Core Philosophy of Microsoft Purview

* **Transparency**: Know where data lives, how it flows, and who uses it.
* **Scalability**: Built to handle petabyte-scale enterprise data estates.
* **Automation**: Reduce manual work with scanning, classification, and policy enforcement.
* **Integration**: Deep integration with Microsoft 365, Azure, Power BI, and Information Protection.

## Chapter 3: Microsoft Purview Architecture and Components

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

Key components:

* **Purview Studio**: Web-based portal for governance operations.
* **Data Map**: Central metadata repository with lineage graphs.
* **Scan Engines**: Connect to data sources and extract metadata.
* **Insights Engine**: Visual dashboards for coverage, sensitivity, health.
* **Policy Layer**: RBAC, access policies, label enforcement.

### 3.2 Data Flow in Purview

Typical flow:

1. **Register Data Source** (e.g., Azure SQL).
2. **Scan and Classify Data** – metadata + PII detection.
3. **Enrich Assets** – tags, glossary, ownership.
4. **Search/Explore** – Unified catalog with filters and endorsements.
5. **Track Lineage** – View how data moves across systems.
6. **Apply Policies** – Define and enforce data access rules.

Purview updates its **Data Map** continuously as scans run.

## Chapter 4: Deep Dive into Core Features

### 4.1 Data Map

* The **foundation** of Purview.
* Scalable graph model of metadata and relationships.
* Stores technical, business, operational, and security metadata.
* Powers the entire platform (catalog, lineage, glossary, policy).

### 4.2 Scanning and Classification

* **Automated** metadata scanning across hybrid environments.
* **Built-in** and **custom** classifications (PII, financial, health data).
* Supports scanning of structured (SQL), semi-structured (JSON, XML), and unstructured data (files).
* **Scheduling**: Daily, weekly, on-demand scans.

### 4.3 Unified Data Catalog

* Enterprise-wide, searchable interface.
* Use **filters**: classification, glossary term, source, owner.
* **User actions**:

  * Bookmark datasets,
  * Endorse high-quality assets,
  * Deprecate unused or outdated ones,
  * Add contact info, purpose, sensitivity.

### 4.4 Business Glossary

* Define **business terms** (e.g., Net Revenue, Active User).
* Assign **owners, synonyms, and acronyms**.
* Organize via **domains and categories**.
* Link terms to assets for better context.
* Promotes **data literacy** across departments.

### 4.5 Lineage

* Visually track **data movement and transformation**.
* Examples:

  * SQL → Data Factory → Power BI
  * Blob Storage → Synapse → Reporting layer
* View **upstream and downstream dependencies**.
* Useful for **impact analysis** and **debugging**.

### 4.6 Access and Policy Management

* Define access control at **collection, source, or column level**.
* Supports **RBAC** and **attribute-based access control**.
* Enforce **data sharing rules**, label-based access (e.g., MIP labels).

### 4.7 Insights and Monitoring

* Built-in dashboards for:

  * Scan coverage,
  * Asset enrichment,
  * Classification volume,
  * Sensitive data exposure trends.
* Alert on **failed scans, low-quality data, or misclassified assets**.

## Chapter 5: Role-Based Use Cases

### 5.1 For Data Analysts

* Search the catalog to find trusted datasets.
* Verify lineage before using a dataset in BI tools.
* Use glossary-linked terms to ensure reporting accuracy.

### 5.2 For Data Stewards

* Assign and validate metadata.
* Create glossary terms.
* Ensure completeness of classifications.

### 5.3 For Compliance Teams

* Discover all sensitive data locations.
* Generate audit-ready reports.
* Create automated policies to reduce manual reviews.

### 5.4 For IT & Security

* Use policy enforcement to protect sensitive files.
* Monitor usage of critical data sources.
* Audit data access and classification trends.
